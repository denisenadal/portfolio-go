The existing invoicing and quotes system in our app wasn't flexible enough to meet the needs of technicians out in the field. Here are some of the common issues our users experienced:

        <h3>Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There was no way to copy a quote from one job to another</li>
            <li>If a technician wanted to sell a homeowner a previously offered quote while in the field, you would have to remake the quote or call the office to complete the paperwork.</li>
            <li>If you were selling a standard flat fee service, you would still have to go through the quote → authorized → invoice → approved process, even just for a dispatch fee.</li>
            <li>Our system couldn't show discounts on quotes. So the homeowner would have to trust the technician that the price will be lower than what the paper shows.</li>
        </ul>
