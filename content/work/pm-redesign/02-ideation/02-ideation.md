After establishing a deep understanding of who we were designing for and understanding the tasks involved, I did a lot of loose sketching on paper to work out my initial ideas. From there I worked up several wireframes, some of which are detailed in the next section

Part of validating this design and workflow was running it through several common and uncommon scenarios. To the left is an example for a common scenario that can be challenging - a landlord calls to schedule work at a tenant's home.
