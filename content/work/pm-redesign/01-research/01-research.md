I spearheaded this project after our new Product Director challenged the UX Team to **test our assumption**s about how our users really do their jobs. Up until this point, we accepted the longstanding assumptions that our organization has built up through the years about what a "job" should look like and what dispatchers and technicians "should" do.

We started this process by **interviewing a former HVAC technician and  a general manage**r for plumbing and HVAC companies. During the interview process we made several discoveries that changed our entire perception of what a "job" was.

Through those interviews, and **discussions with technicians** at HVAC conferences, we learned about the kind of people who gravitate towards this work, and combining this insight with **industry research** I was able to build personas for our 4 basic user groups: owners, dispatchers, customer service reps, and technicians.

By building out these **detailed personas based on real data** rather that anecdotal evidence, it became easier to focus in on the right workflows and solutions. All the insights we gained as a Product &  UX Team through this process later informed the best design work we had done as a team.
