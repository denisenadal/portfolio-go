### Quick Add Jobs Feature 
(August 2019)

While we trying to get the previous solution ("Summary" view feature) going, we ran an experiment to test a different strategy. We created a simple modal to contain the existing search tool, and a basic form for creating jobs. It made it simple and quick to schedule a job.

David Cloyd and I brainstormed this idea in a moment of **creative ideation**, by *focusing on the problem, and not a feature.* 

Because this project was framed as an "experiment" or code-based prototype, we set specific metrics that we wanted to measure to be able to call the feature a success. First, we wanted to reduce the number of clicks required to schedule a job to less than 10, and we got it down to 7. We also wanted at 65% of our users to try it within a week. We had around 70% try it at least once.
