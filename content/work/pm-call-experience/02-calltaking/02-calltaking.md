### Call Taking Feature  
(June 2018 - April 2019)

Our first attempt at solving this problem was building a "Call Taking" feature. The idea was to create a search tool that would look up homeowners by either the owner, or the home.  After finding the person or house, you would pull up information about them, and then be able to schedule a job at their house.

It was a struggle for many reasons. The project began with a list of user requests we were to treat as requirements. We didn't do enough research to understand what problem we were trying to solve and how users would actually use our solution. We struggled to figure out how to collaborate effectively. When trying to leverage existing components to speed up development, it created more problems than it solved. We were all unhappy with what we built. 

*We managed to build the feature that was requested - but **we didn't meet what the users really needed.***
