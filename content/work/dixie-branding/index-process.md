Since the focus of this app was to scan for devices on wireless networks and test security protocols, I wanted to develop a brand that would reflect a focus on security. I choose a dark theme and a classic shade of green to reflect the old-school aesthetic of Command Line Interfaces from the 1980's. I contrasted them with a purplish light gray to give it a modern twist.
