I broke the design work into two stages, designing page layout (how components are structured and organized) and component visual design (how the components look). I was able to provide the Brand team with several variations on both layouts and component designs that match with the existing design system for the Seagram's Escapes brand. 

We reviewed the mockups together and collaboratively made revisions until the Brand team was satisfied that it met their expectations. Once everyone was happy with the designs, development work began
