Our campus is always growing, so we needed a campus map that could change as quickly as our campus. Our previous map options were a 3-D interactive map, which was fun and engaging, but impossible to update, or simply displaying a pdf of the print map. I opted to create a customized Google Map application, which is responsive and easy to use on all devices.
