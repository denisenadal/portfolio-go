This was project I did for fun & self-learning in my feel time, so I didn’t have any formal or structured design process for this. I focused on creating a fun and visually exciting interface that still puts the content at the center of attention.

## Development
I’ve been working my way through freecodecamp’s “Front End Dev” projects to keep my node.js fresh since I primarily use Wordpress on a LAMP stack at work. Fow this assignment, the project was fairly basic, create service to allow users to search through images and receive indexed page results back as JSON. 

I decided to make it more challenging and interesting by working with Flickr’s API to use their database of images, and create a web interface for the search API service I was building. I also used handlebars.js to handle templating for the  search results. My version of the project allows users to search for images posted to flickr by keyword, or get a list of recent images, and the results can be view either as html or JSON.
