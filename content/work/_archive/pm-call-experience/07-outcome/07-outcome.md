### Results

We tried four different solutions, two of them we successfully implemented and two that we not. We did make things easier for users, but we never finished creating a user focused app, and because our app never overcame the usability issues, it never became successful. 

We wasted so much time on trying "small fixes" and "working with what we have" that we didn't have enough time left to do the most important work. 

### Learnings

In hindsight, we learned how much harder it is to add a "good experience" retroactively rather than building right from the start, or even just rebuilding from scratch.

I learned how important it is to take the time to do thorough research, even on a subject you think you already know.

I also learned how vital it is to continuously be advocating for UX design and refocusing a team's efforts to making lives better for users.
