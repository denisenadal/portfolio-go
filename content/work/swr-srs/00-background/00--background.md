Pointman's SuccessWare Remote is an app that integrates with SucessWare21, allowing technicians in the field to access data from their office's scheduling software. We have an administration site, called SRS, which is used by the Pointaman support team and the owners/administrators of companies using SWR. The site allows users to access account and workflow settings, which changes the kinds of tasks and the level of information seen by technicians who use the software on their mobile devices.

For instance, Brad owns an HVAC company, and Ted is one of his technicians. Ted is new, so Brad doesn't want him to sell quotes to customers. Brad can log into SRS and disable the quoting system for Ted, so he doesn't try to do anything he's not supposed to. Meanwhile, Ivan is an installer, and he always forgets to get customers to sign off on his work. Brad can log into SRS and turn on a feature that will prompt Ivan to get a signature every time he completes a job.

While there's a large amount of helpful features in the SRS admin site, its hard to navigate and users often have trouble using it without assistance. In order to improve user satisfaction and engagement while also decreasing the costs of support, we launched an initiative to redesign the whole admin site from the ground up.
