For the design of this portfolio site, I knew I wanted something bright and fun and reflective of my personality and design taste. I love bright, bold colors and designs and wanted the challenge of using them in my portfolio. This site was also a chance for me to work on crafting a clear narrative targeted towards a specific user experience.
