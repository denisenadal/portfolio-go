I started this site by spending a few weeks sketching out ideas as thumbnails and storyboards. Once I had clear idea about what I wanted the site to look and feel like, I took it to mockups and began figuring out the details of the design. From there I built it out into code. 

It has undergone several iterations, first as a simple php site, then as WordPress theme, and finally a customized php CMS. The latest incarnation is using Hugo as a templating engine.
