I was assigned to to the engineering and design work for this project. Our customers wanted several small improvements to the invoices generated by our software, as well as the ability to use them with windowed envelopes.

I enjoyed doing the design work, and trying to get the alignment of pts  and pixels and final printed output to match.
The process we were using to generate the pdfs was very difficult to understand, and in the end, our Senior Front-End Engineer took over the implementation.
