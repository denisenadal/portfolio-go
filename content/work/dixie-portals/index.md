Like most university websites, the frontpage of dixie.edu is targeted towards prospective students. This leaves other user groups such as current students, faculty, staff and community members lost when trying to find content relevant to their needs. 
Redesigning our “portal” pages to be effective homepages or dashboards for each user group was a critical issue and top priority for our team that year. Because the existing portal pages were the result of rushing through the design process, for this iteration we took our time to get things right. We rolled out the new portals one at a time from November 2017 to March 2018.
