Like most university websites, the frontpage of dixie.edu is targeted towards prospective students. This leaves other user groups such as current students, faculty, staff and community members lost when trying to find content relevant to their needs. 
Redesigning our “portal” pages to be effective homepages or dashboards for each user group was a critical issue and top priority for our team that year.
