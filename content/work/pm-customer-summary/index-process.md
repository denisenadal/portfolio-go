One of the most frequent complaints about the Pointman app was that it was difficult to view information about customers and jobs, because the information was spread out across several
screen.

Between projects, I took to the initiative to start exploring screen layouts to show all  relevant information on one screen. I started with really basic information design, based on the common workflow for a Customer Service Rep scheduling a new job for their organization.

Although the designs received positive feedback from stakeholders, they were tabled until Engineering had capacity to take on the project.

Some time later, improving the user experience with Pointman became a company objective, and this  project because the focus on the Product and Engineering Teams. During this round, I dived deep into exploring the customer journey and tested my designs against several key workflows. With guidance from the Product Director we were able to come up with a fresh modern design that made it easy to complete common tasks.

Unfortunately, after completing the designs, the timeline to deliver the final project wasn't
acceptable to the Strategy Team, and we pivoted to a new project.
