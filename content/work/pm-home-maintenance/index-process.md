The process for this project was fast and experimental. We conducted several rounds of lean experiments to test hypotheses about the market, as well as using several methods to collect  first-hand personal experiences to inform our thinking. Some of the methods we used were in-depth interviews, guerilla surveys, paid surveys, casually interviewing everyone we know and looking at general market data. We also conducted collaborative design sessions and workshops to define our personas, customer journey, understand the problem space, ideate product opportunities and define and test a value proposition.
