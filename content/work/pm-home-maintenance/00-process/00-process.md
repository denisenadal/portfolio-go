### Understand the Problem Space

We conducted several rounds of **lean experiments** to test hypotheses about the market, as well as using several methods to collect first-hand personal experiences to inform our thinking.

Some of the methods we used were **in-depth interviews, guerilla surveys, paid surveys**, informally interviewing everyone we know and looking at general market data. Some of the most common sentiments we heard from homeowners are listed to the right.

Below are some examples of the experiments we ran.

### Define The Problem

Using our research we were able to define our **personas,** their experiences, and clarify **the biggest impact problem** we could solve for them. 

We build a **customer journey map** of their experience hiring a contractor for home repairs. We were able to distill all of the complexities around planning and conducting home repair to two problem statements.
{{%/markdown%}}
<div class="text-light bg-info p-3 my-4">
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <ol class="lead">
        <li> Homeowners don't know how to tell if they are getting a "good deal" (paying fairly for quality and necessary work)</li>
        <li>Homeowners frequently end up paying too much for repairs because they didn't do or don't know how to do regular maintenance.</li>
    </ol>

### Ideate

We also conducted **collaborative design sessions** and **workshops** to ideate product opportunities and define and test a **value proposition**.

### Next Steps

Next we would have tested several of our best ideas for viability, desirability, and feasibility.
