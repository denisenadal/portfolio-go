The final result was a pitch deck that we presented to the CEO. The summary of our pitch is as follows:
> Homeowners end up paying almost 10K a year in unexpected hidden costs most of which could have been avoided with regular, simple maintenance.
> Let's make it easy for homeowners to save money and protect their homes with a subscription service that provides regular maintenance.
>Over $80 billion is spent on home repairs each year and of the homeowners we've talked to 75% are interested in a service to provide regular maintenance.
>Now is the time to act. There's only a handful of competitors trying similar ideas and no one is doing it right.
>This is a real opportunity to help homeowners build wealth and invest in their  homes and communities.
