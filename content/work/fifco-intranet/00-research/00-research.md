### Business goals

- Need an easy way to share and update content with all FIFCO employees, including Costa Rica, that works on any device. The existing solution (sharepoint) is full of outdated content, is difficult to use, and not responsive.
- Need a single source of truth for company policies and procedures and place to embody company culture and drive change.
- **What outcomes do you want to achieve â€” are they measurable?**
    - Improve communication between CR and USA
    - Improve cross functional communication between teams
    - Less duplication of resources

## User Research
We used a combination of interviews and surveys to uncover the common needs of employees at FIFCO USA. Based on the responses we received we were able to determine what content needed to be added to the site and what links needed highest visibility and ease of access. We were able to use these insights to design our site navigation and information architecture.
