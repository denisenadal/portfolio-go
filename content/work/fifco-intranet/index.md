In late 2020 the IT Team was approached by the Talent team to explore solutions for a company intranet. After discussion we agreed that WordPress would be a cost-effective and scalable solution that would be easy for users to use and for us to maintain. We did extensive user research and collaborative design to make sure we were building the right product for our team.
Because we designed and developed the intranet on top of our regular duties, the full process, including socialing the project and training users took just under one year.
